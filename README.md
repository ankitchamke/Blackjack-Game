# 🃏 Blackjack Game - Day 22 of #100DaysOfCode

This is a simple **Blackjack game** built using **JavaScript** as part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/ankitchamke/100-days-of-code) challenge.

## 📆 Day 22 Highlights
- Built a fully functioning Blackjack game.
- Used `if-else` conditions, `arrays`, and `random number generation` logic.
- Practiced DOM manipulation and user interaction via buttons and text updates.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Click **"Start Game"** to deal two random cards.
2. Click **"New Card"** to draw another.
3. Try to reach a sum of **21** without going over it.
4. Game gives feedback like "You're in the game", "Blackjack!", or "You're out!".
